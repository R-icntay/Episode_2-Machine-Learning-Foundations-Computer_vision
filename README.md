# Machine Learning Foundations: Ep #2- First steps in Computer Vision
 

Hello! Welcome to the second **R** code walkthrough of the session ***Machine Learning Foundations*** where the awesome [Laurence Moroney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-moroney),a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence, takes you through the fundamentals of building machine learning models using TensorFlow.

In the second YouTube session, [Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-35y1M9rRU&t=186s), Laurence Moroney takes us through yet another exciting application of Machine Learning.
Here, we go beyond “Hello World” and start applying the fundamental patterns of building a neural network to more sophisticated scenarios, beginning with **computer vision**--how a computer can learn to “see.”
